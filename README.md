# TG-WhatsApp

> Get WhatsApp messages on Telegram and Reply from Telegram!

### Features :

- Realtime delivery of messages from whatsapp to telegram and vice-versa.
- Supports both personal messages and group messages.

### Why This Exists?

Being an active telegram user and a person who don't like to use Whatsapp, but still wants to keep connected with friends.
A solution for the same would be using a bridge between both the apps. Yes, I know this already [exists](https://github.com/WhatsGram/WhatsGram), but unfortunately its not handling the group messages like what i was expecting. So I decided to create a similar one with multidevice support from [Tuhin's WhatApp userbot](https://github.com/tuhinpal/WhatsBot). In short you can call it as a fork of both [WhatsGram](https://github.com/WhatsGram/WhatsGram) and [WhatsBot](https://github.com/tuhinpal/WhatsBot). ~~I know , you know a better name , but still i love to call it as a fork. :/~~

For detailed instructions on how to deploy and run your own bot, refer [this wiki page of WhatsBot](https://github.com/tuhinpal/WhatsBot/wiki)

- After succesfull deployment,add the telegram bot to telegram group and whatsapp user to whatsapp group and send `/connect` in your telegram group or `!connect <telegram chat id>` in your whatsapp group to connect both the group.
